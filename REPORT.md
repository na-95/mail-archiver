##My Approach

ReactJS was used to create the mail archiver UI. It was a bit challenging as it tested my existing knowledge about the front-end tools. One thing that I realized after completing
the project is that the most important skill is not to know as much as you can, but rather it is the ability to go digging for the solutions of the problem at hand; via documentations,
articles and websites such as stackoverflow.

Since, I am a an entry-level developer, it took me a whole day to design and implement the code. My code could have been a lot better since the current one is quite unstructured and 
difficult to maintain, essentially what is called a 'spaghetti code'. But I am confident that with time and consistent effort, my skill to write clean, easy-to-maintain and reusable
code will improve.
